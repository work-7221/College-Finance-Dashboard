# College-Finance-Dashboard

### With the help of this dashboard, students in Bennett University will be able to track their monthly expenses in accordance to a budget and store those budgets efficiently.


This is a my college project where i have made a college finance dashboard specifically for student of Bennett University where student will be able to track their expenses and keep a track where all the money goes.
Often students are unable to keep an efficient track of all the expenses made in college, the money either goes into spending over food, some essential items, and many times it goes untracked, hence resulting in a "unexpected" over spending of money than what was planned.

With the help of this streamlit based web app students will be able to keep a track of their monthly expenses. The data is stored in mysql database and hence the web app is able to keep a record of all the expenses made. It gives clear information where the money has been spent with the help of a user friendly frontend.

### The college finance dashboard is capable to show:

- Expenses made.
- Pie charts & progress bars showing the distributions of those expenses.
